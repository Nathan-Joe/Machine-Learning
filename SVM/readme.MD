Hello TA's, so my primal work perfectly fine, my dual linear also work totally fines. However, the gaussian seems have a little bit problem with the run time. 
I tried running it and for 30 mins, it is still running. I assume this is because of the double loop(?), but not too sure if there is any other way to change it.
